Rani Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi 
19 November 1828 — 18 June 1858),was the Maharani consort of the princely state of Jhansi from 1843 to 1853 by marriage 
to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. She was one of the leading figures in the Indian Rebellion of 
1857, who became a national hero and symbol of resistance to the British rule in India for Indian 
nationalists.

Born into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family in Benares, Lakshmibai married the Maharaja of Jhansi, 
Gangadhar Rao, in 1842. When the Maharaja died in 1853, the British East India Company under 
Governor-General Lord Dalhousie refused to recognize the claim of his adopted heir and annexed 
Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse. The Rani was unwilling to cede control and joined the rebellion 
against the British in 1857. She led the successful defense of Jhansi against Company allies, 
but in early 1858 Jhansi fell to British forces under the command of Hugh Rose. The Rani managed 
to escape on horseback and joined the rebels in capturing Gwalior, where they proclaimed Nana Saheb 
as Peshwa of the revived Maratha Empire. She died in June 1858 after being mortally wounded during 
the British counterattack at Gwalior. She died at an early age.

<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>
    Rani Lakshmibai (or Rani Lakshmi Bai) was born on 19 November 1828 (in the town of Benares (now Varanasi) into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family.[7] She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.[8] Her father was Moropant Tambe[9] and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra.[10] Her mother died when she was four years old. Her father was a Commander during the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district.[11] The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "beautiful " and "lively and cheerful". She was educated at home and was taught to read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting, horsemanship, fencing[12][13] and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tantia Tope.[14][15][dubious – discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at this time.[16] And she was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to fight against social norms even in front of the whole society.

Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the palace and the temple, although sometimes she was carried in a palanquin.[17] Her horses included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according to historians she rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858. Her palace, the Rani Mahal, has now been converted into a museum. It houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th centuries AD.
